Stock Movement Analysis Based on Social Media Sentiment
Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict stock price movements by leveraging sentiment analysis of social media data. By extracting relevant discussions from platforms such as Reddit, we aim to understand how public sentiment correlates with stock performance. The sentiment is derived from stock-related posts, and the goal is to explore how sentiment trends can potentially influence stock price changes.


Key Features:
Data Collection: Scraping posts from subreddits like r/wallstreetbets and r/stocks.
Sentiment Analysis: Analyzing public sentiment using natural language processing techniques.
Stock Price Prediction: Investigating the relationship between sentiment and stock price movement using historical stock price data.

#Project Objectives
#Scrape Reddit posts using Pythonâ€™s asyncpraw library and extract stock mentions for companies such as Apple, Tesla, AMD, Google, and Microsoft.
#Perform sentiment analysis on scraped Reddit posts to categorize sentiment into positive, neutral, or negative classes.
#Integrate historical stock price data to analyze the impact of sentiment on stock movements.
#Build a predictive model that can anticipate stock price changes based on social media sentiment.
